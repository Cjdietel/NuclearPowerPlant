# 💡 Nuclear Power Plant

A full-featured **Nuclear Reactor Simulation and Monitoring Dashboard** built with React. This project simulates real-time control and visualization of multiple nuclear reactors by interacting with an external API. Features include real-time temperature graphs, control rod manipulation, coolant toggling, emergency shutdowns, and detailed system logs.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔄 **Live Reactor Updates** — Real-time data fetching and visualization for each reactor.
- 📈 **Graphical Temperature Logs** — Dynamic temperature graphs updated every few seconds.
- 🎛 **Reactor Controls** — Perform actions like:
  - Lowering/raising control rods
  - Turning coolant on/off
  - Emergency and controlled shutdown
  - Refueling and starting reactors
  - Maintenance mode
- 🧾 **System Logs** — Output logs from reactors displayed with scrollable history.
- 🧠 **Custom Naming** — Rename both the plant and individual reactors from the dashboard.
- 🗺 **Two Views** — High-level dashboard view and detailed single-reactor view.
